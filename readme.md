## Introduction
By now you should have a basic understanding of Terraform and how it works. If not, please read the [Terraform Getting Started Guide first](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html). And be very comfortable with writing HCL code. We would move forward with migrating our infrastructure to Terraform Cloud and also configuring the deployment to work using Ansible, and Packer for building the images.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) is installed on your local machine.
